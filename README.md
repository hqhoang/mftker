MacroFusion in TKinter


Tried to add masks to MacroFusion (https://github.com/salvadhor/macrofusion), but it's a little too outdated to work on. Decided to rewrite MacroFusion from scratch as a chance to learn Python and Tkinter.

Requirements:
* align_image_stack
* enfuse
* exiftool
* TkinterDND2 (pip install tkinterdnd2)
* Pillow (pip install Pillow)
* OpenCV (pip install opencv, or, pip install opencv-contrib-python)
